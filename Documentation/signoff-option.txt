--signoff[=<mode>]::
--no-signoff::
	Add a `Signed-off-by` trailer by the committer at the end of the commit
	log message.  The meaning of a signoff depends on the project
	to which you're committing.  For example, it may certify that
	the committer has the rights to submit the work under the
	project's license or agrees to some contributor representation,
	such as a Developer Certificate of Origin.
	(See http://developercertificate.org for the one used by the
	Linux kernel and Git projects.)  Consult the documentation or
	leadership of the project to which you're contributing to
	understand how the signoffs are used in that project.
+
The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier --signoff
option on the command line.
+
The mode parameter is optional (defaults to no-dedup), and is used to specify
if it should deduplicate the `Signed-off-by` trailer or not when trying to
add it to the trailers.
+
The possible options are:
+
	- 'no-dedup' - Will add the trailer unless it's already the last line.
	- 'dedup' - Will not add the trailer if it's already anywhere in the
	  trailers.
