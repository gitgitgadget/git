git-config-batch(1)
===================

NAME
----
git-config-batch - Get and set options using machine-parseable interface


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git config-batch' <options>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Tools frequently need to change their behavior based on values stored in
Git's configuration files. These files may have complicated conditions
for including extra files, so it is difficult to produce an independent
parser. To avoid executing multiple processes to discover or modify
multiple configuration values, the `git config-batch` command allows a
single process to handle multiple requests using a machine-parseable
interface across `stdin` and `stdout`.

PROTOCOL
--------
By default, the protocol uses line feeds (`LF`) to signal the end of a
command over `stdin` or a response over `stdout`.

The protocol will be extended in the future, and consumers should be
resilient to older Git versions not understanding the latest command
set. Thus, if the Git version includes the `git config-batch` builtin
but doesn't understand an input command, it will return a single line
response:

```
unknown_command LF
```
