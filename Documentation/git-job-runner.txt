=================

NAME
----
git-job-runner - run jobs on multiple repos according to a schedlue.
Intended for background operation.


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git job-runner [--repo=<path>]'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Run jobs in a loop with some frequency. Intended for running in the
background.

The `git run-job <job-name>` command runs a specific maintenance task.
The `job-runner` command is a long-running process that calls the
`run-job` command on a set of repositories at some frequency. The
`job.*` config values customize the frequencies of these jobs.


OPTIONS
-------

--repo=<dir>::
	If at least one `--repo` option is provided, the runner only
	attempts running jobs on repositories located at the provided
	`<dir>` values. This option can be specified multiple times.

--interval=<span>::
	The job runner pauses between each attempt to run jobs. Use the
	specified `<span>` as a number of seconds between each attempt.
	If this is not specified, then the default will be found from
	`jobs.loopInterval` or the default value of 30 minutes.

--daemonize::
	If supported by your platform, launch an identical
	`git job-runner` process in the background and close the
	foreground process immediately.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

The `git job-runner` command is intended to run as a long-running
process. The following config options are checked periodically during
the process and will modify its behavior:
