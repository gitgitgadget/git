git-hook(1)
===========

NAME
----
git-hook - Manage configured hooks

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git hook' -l | --list <hook-name>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
You can list, add, and modify hooks with this command.

This command parses the default configuration files for sections "hook" and
"hookcmd". "hook" is used to describe the commands which will be run during a
particular hook event; commands are run in config order. "hookcmd" is used to
describe attributes of a specific command. If additional attributes don't need
to be specified, a command to run can be specified directly in the "hook"
section; if a "hookcmd" by that name isn't found, Git will attempt to run the
provided value directly. For example:

Global config
----
  [hook "post-commit"]
    command = "linter"
    command = "~/typocheck.sh"

  [hookcmd "linter"]
    command = "/bin/linter --c"
----

Local config
----
  [hook "prepare-commit-msg"]
    command = "linter"
  [hook "post-commit"]
    command = "python ~/run-test-suite.py"
----

OPTIONS
-------
