job.loopInterval::
	The number of seconds to sleep between rounds of running
	background jobs in `git job-runner`.

job.<job-name>.enabled::
	If set to `false`, this option will disable the `<job-name>`
	when run by `git job-runner`.

job.<job-name>.interval::
	The minimum number of seconds between runs of
	`git run-job <job-name>` when running `git job-runner`.

job.<job-name>.lastRun::
	The Unix epoch for the timestamp of the previous run of
	`git run-job <job-name>` when running `git job-runner`. You
	can manually update this to a later time to delay a specific
	job on this repository.

job.loose-objects.batchSize::
	This string value `<count>` limits the number of loose-objects
	collected into a single pack-file during the `loose-objects`
	job. Default batch size is fifty thousand. See linkgit:git-run-job[1]
	for more details.

job.pack-files.batchSize::
	This string value `<size>` will be passed to the
	`git multi-pack-index repack --batch-size=<size>` command as
	part of `git run-job pack-files`. If not specified, then a
	dynamic size calculation is run. See linkgit:git-run-job[1]
	for more details.

job.repo::
	Store an absolute path to a repository that wants background
	jobs run by `git job-runner`. This is a multi-valued config
	option, but it must be stored in a config file seen by the
	background runner. This may be the global or system config
	depending on how `git job-runner` is launched on your system.
